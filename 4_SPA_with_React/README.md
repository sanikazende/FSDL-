### Setup and Running 

1. Create a new React project using Create React App:
   ```npx create-react-app react-spa-example```
   ```cd react-spa-example```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```npm install react-router-dom```
3. Replace the contents of ```src/App.js``` with the code provided in the artifact.
4. Run the development server:
```npm start```

This will start your React application, and you should be able to see it running at ```http://localhost:3000```.
